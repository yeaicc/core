# Official Microsoft Docs

Microsoft maintains official documentation for .NET, listed below. Both .NET Core and .NET Framework docs are relevant to .NET Core developers, both because many .NET Framework APIs are part of .NET Core (most relevant for .NET Core 2.0) but also because you can reference .NET Framework libraries with .NET Standard 2.0.

## .NET Core

- [Conceptual docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/)
- [API docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/api/)

## .NET Framework

- [Conceptual docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/w0x726c2.aspx)
- [API docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt472912.aspx)

Note: .NET Framework docs will be moving to docs.microsoft.com in 2017.
